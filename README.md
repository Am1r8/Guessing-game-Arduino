# Guessing game

A game made with Arduino for my computer engineering. 

This board uses a buzzer, LCD 16x2, 4 Led, and 4 buttons.

The game will start and it shows you colors and you have to choose the correct button from right to left.
if you lose the game will show you the correct one and you have to start from the beginning.
if you win you proceed to a new level and the game gets much harder as you proceed!
There is no time limit so you can take your time!
